This software is for animating physically simulated elastoplastic amorphous objects. It uses polyscope (https://polyscope.run/) for visualization and GUI.

**DiffMPMLib3D** is the main library for all differentiable MPM and optimization.

**DiffMPMAnimator3D** is the polyscope app for running the algorithms and visualizing data.

**PointCloudMesher** is another polyscope app which also creates meshes out of point clouds and outputs screenshots for animation.
